# Sprint 2 Status Summary

## Completed Work

### 1. ‚úÖ Firestore Security Rules (Updated)
- **File**: `firestore.rules`
- Added validation for profile fields:
  - `displayName`: 2-50 characters
  - `zipCode`: 5-digit pattern
  - `bio`: max 500 characters
  - `interests`: 3-20 items
- Added `verificationRequests` collection rules
- Protected `verificationStatus` (admin-only field)

### 2. ‚úÖ Storage Security Rules (Updated)
- **File**: `storage.rules`
- Restricted image uploads to: JPEG, JPG, PNG, WebP
- Changed from generic `image/.*` to specific formats

### 3. ‚úÖ Sprint 2 Seed Script (Created)
- **File**: `scripts/seed/sprint2-profiles.ts`
- Adds profile data to 10 test users
- Includes: bio, interests, children ages, verification status
- **Commands**:
  - `npm run seed:sprint2` (local)
  - `npm run seed:sprint2:dev` (dev environment)

### 4. ‚úÖ E2E Tests (Created)
- **Files**:
  - `tests/e2e/sprint2/onboarding.spec.ts` - Tests 4-step onboarding flow
  - `tests/e2e/sprint2/profile.spec.ts` - Tests profile view/edit
- Tests cover validation, navigation, and data persistence

### 5. ‚úÖ Bug Fixes
- Fixed Input component text color (was white on white)
- Fixed Input component hydration issue (replaced Math.random() with useId())

## üî¥ Current Issue: Firebase Auth Login Failure

### Problem Description
Login is failing with `auth/user-not-found` error despite users being successfully seeded into the Firebase Auth emulator.

### Root Cause Analysis
The Firebase emulator was importing old data from a previous project (`todo-d5a92`), causing a project ID mismatch. Even after:
1. Deleting `firebase-emulator-data` directory
2. Starting fresh emulator without import
3. Reseeding users

The login still fails. The browser appears to have cached the old Firebase connection.

### What Has Been Tried
1. ‚úÖ Cleared emulator data completely
2. ‚úÖ Started emulator fresh without import flag
3. ‚úÖ Reseeded Sprint 1 and Sprint 2 data (10 users created successfully)
4. ‚úÖ Added `storageState: undefined` to Playwright config
5. ‚úÖ Restarted dev server
6. ‚ùå Login still fails in both browser and E2E tests

### Current State
- **Emulator**: Running on port 9099 ‚úÖ
- **Users**: 10 test users created in Auth emulator ‚úÖ
- **Seed Data**: Profile data added successfully ‚úÖ
- **Login**: Failing with `auth/user-not-found` ‚ùå

### Test Credentials
```
Email: verified.parent@test.com
Password: Test123!
```

### Diagnostic Commands
```bash
# Check emulator status
open http://localhost:4000/auth

# Run seed scripts
npm run seed:sprint1
npm run seed:sprint2

# Run E2E test
npx playwright test tests/e2e/sprint1/login.spec.ts:29 --project=chromium
```

### Next Steps to Try
1. **Clear browser IndexedDB**: The Firebase SDK might be caching project info in IndexedDB
2. **Add explicit browser context cleanup** in Playwright tests
3. **Verify emulator project ID** matches client config (both should be `zipparents-local`)
4. **Check for multiple emulator instances** running simultaneously
5. **Test manual login** in browser with dev tools open to see exact error

### Files Modified in This Session

### Environment Status
- **Dev Server**: Running on http://localhost:3000 ‚úÖ
- **Emulator**: Running on http://localhost:4000 ‚úÖ
- **Auth Emulator**: Port 9099 ‚úÖ
- **Firestore Emulator**: Port 8080 ‚úÖ
